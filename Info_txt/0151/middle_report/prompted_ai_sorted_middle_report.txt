" We are trying to trace the a company's shareholding structure and its changes, 
we have a txt file recording such information, any ``Group`` information is a description of company's shareholding 
structure or its changes consist of 3 parts, summary, main csv table, notation, where summary explain what the 
``Group`` do. main csv table is the record the current shareholding structure or the change of the current 
shareholding structure. The notation is an explanation of some entries in the main CSV table, to help us understand 
the true shareholding structure of the company, which may have: (1) Notation of a person to say he control a company 
in the CSV table (2) Notation of a company to indicate it holds shares through its subsidiaries (3) Notation to 
clarify cross-shareholding relationships between companies (4) Notation to explain indirect shareholding through 
multiple layers of companies (5) Notation to explain complex financial instruments that may convert to shares{We 
don't care about the difference between the different shares, we only care about shares end up in the hands of what 
company or whoever.}. Ultimately, you need to construct a txt file consist of entities, overview and message, 
where entities is a summary of person or company we mention in the input file in the order of equity/share percentage, we care about the shares in his hands,
overview is a overview of the share hold structure at this time, in the order of equity/share percentage. Message is change of share hold structure at this 
time. If we do not overview, then we need message, otherwise, if we do have overview now, we only need a little important 
message. Here, because our content is a combination of two files, it is possible that the same table separated 
into two groups, so you can consider the corresponding two groups merged together. Here is the format: Time:{2023.6
