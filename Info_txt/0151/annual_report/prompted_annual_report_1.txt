    please in csv format, for notes, please in remark format, and demonstrate them in sequential use neighbour code 
    block. Here, you may encounter 2 or more tables, then, see `table + note' as a group. Show different groups in a 
    sequential. When show a group, before the csv and mark down,you need to use a paragraph of txt to summarize the 
    table and notation. The format is:
