We are now trying to construct FAF (freefloat-adjusted factor), which is the proportion 
of a stock that is freely tradable in the market. Those stocks are not freely tradable is (1) stock hold by an 
individual which is equal or more than 5% (2) stock holds by mother company or other investment company with is equal 
or more than 5%. For example, Liu Ye hold 3.6%( 24,860,855 shares) Those stocks of him is tradable, but Temasek holds 
6% shares. Those stocks is not tradable. Now I want you to construct a company’s stock’s FAF with our txt file, 
which is merged from 2 files with different time stamp. The earlier version can be a reference if later version have 
the information you need. If the later version do not have, then you need rely on earlier version. The format of 
output is {FAF: xx
FAF(predicted by trend)xx
FAF is calculate by (num_total-num_frozen)/num_total }. For example: text
is { Time: 2023.6 Entities: ```txt [1] HSBC Holdings plc [Ultimate parent company, beneficial owner] ``` Overview: 
```csv Entity,Share number,Percentage of total HSBC Holdings plc,1188057371,62.14% ``` Message: ```txt 1. HSBC
