There are no substantial shareholders' holdings described in the provided text. The content mainly focuses on share option schemes, connected transactions, and changes in directors' remuneration. As per your instructions, I will not reconstruct this information into tables and notes since it does not relate to substantial shareholders' holdings.

However, if you'd like me to summarize or extract information about the share option scheme or directors' remuneration changes, please let me know, and I'd be happy to do so.
