    please in csv format, for notes, please in remark format, and demonstrate them in sequential use neighbour code 
    block. Here, you may encounter 2 or more tables, then, see `table + note' as a group. Show different groups in a 
    sequential. When show a group, before the csv and mark down,you need to use a paragraph of txt to summarize the

paid.
The ordinary shares are non-redeemable and are entitled to dividends. Each ordinary share carries one vote. In the
case of winding up of the Company, ordinary shares carry the right to return the paid-up capital and any balance then
remaining.
During the period ended 30 June 2023, there were no repurchase of the Company’s shares. During the period ended

Share options
The Group operates a share option scheme for directors, employees and others whom the Board of Directors
considers, in its sole discretion, have contributed or will contribute to the Group. The share option scheme is effective
for a period of ten years from the date it was adopted, after which no new share options will be granted but the
provisions of the scheme will remain in full force and effect in all other respects. The share options are subject to
terms as the Board of Directors may determine. Such terms may include the exercise price of the share options,
the minimum period for which the share options must be held before they can be exercised in whole or in part, the
conditions that must be reached before the share options can be exercised. The Group has no legal or constructive
obligation to repurchase or settle the share options in cash. No options were granted under the share option scheme
during the six months ended 30 June 2023 (period ended 30 June 2022: 9,250,000 options).
The total expense recognized in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income for share options
granted to directors and employees during the six months ended 30 June 2023 was HK$7,113,000 (six months
ended 30 June 2022: HK$14,172,000) which has no impact to the Group’s cash flows. The weighted average fair
value of options granted was determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The total fair value of options
granted is amortized over the vesting period. The significant inputs into the model included share price at the grant
date, exercise price, estimated volatility, estimated dividend yield based on historical dividend per share, expected
option life and annual risk-free interest rate. The volatility was measured based on historic average share price
volatility over a period of similar maturity to those of the share options.
