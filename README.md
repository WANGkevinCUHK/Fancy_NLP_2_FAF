# 🤖 NLP to FAF: Equity Document Analysis Pipeline 📊

## 🎯 Objective
Transform diverse equity documents into Free Asset Float (FAF) factor using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## 📄 Document Types
- 📜 Equity Certificates
- 📝 Disclosure Forms
- 📊 Annual Reports
- 🗂️ Regulatory Filings

## 🔄 Process Flow

### 1. 📥 Data Ingestion
- [ ] Set up document intake system
- [ ] Implement OCR for scanned documents
- [ ] Establish data validation checks

### 2. 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- [ ] Clean and normalize text
- [ ] Remove irrelevant information
- [ ] Standardize document formats

### 3. 🧠 NLP Model Development
- [ ] Design custom NER (Named Entity Recognition) model
- [ ] Train model on labeled equity documents
- [ ] Implement text classification for document types

### 4. 🔍 Information Extraction
- [ ] Extract key data points (e.g., total shares, restricted shares)
- [ ] Identify ownership percentages
- [ ] Detect lock-up periods and restrictions

### 5. 🧮 FAF Calculation
- [ ] Develop algorithm for FAF computation
- [ ] Implement quality checks for calculated values
- [ ] Create confidence scoring system for results

### 6. 📊 Data Visualization
- [ ] Design interactive dashboard for FAF insights
- [ ] Implement time-series analysis of FAF changes
- [ ] Create comparative tools for multiple equities

### 7. 🔁 Continuous Improvement
- [ ] Set up feedback loop for model refinement
- [ ] Implement version control for NLP models
- [ ] Establish regular retraining schedule

## 🎉 Expected Outcomes
1. Automated FAF calculation from diverse document sources
2. Improved accuracy in market liquidity assessment
3. Scalable system for processing large volumes of equity documents

## 🚀 Next Steps
- [ ] Secure funding for project implementation
- [ ] Assemble cross-functional team (NLP experts, financial analysts, data engineers)
- [ ] Develop project timeline and milestones
